# Navier-Stokes
This is a project for the Numerical Method for Partial Differential Equation of Politecnico di Milano

Students: Simone Foder√†, Matteo Rigamonti

## The logical approach is:
- Start with the Stokes problem done in the laboratory #09
- Implement it for the new mesh
- Study of the Reynolds number
- Add time dependency in Stokes equation (Step vs Ramp)
- Do non-linearity stationary Navier-Stokes
- Merge the non-linearity and time dependency
- Study of the convergence of the problem and study of qualitative behaviour
